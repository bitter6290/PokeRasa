# PokeRasa
Implementation of the Pokemon battle engine in Unity, with a few overworld functions planned as well.


# Features
- Comprehensive Pokémon data structures, with plans to include all released Pokémon
- Fully functioning battle system, with plans to include all moves, abilities and regional gimmicks (Megas, Z-moves, etc.)
- Accessible scripting system for overworld characters and scripts
- Map editor included in the Map Maker scene

# Progress
- All moves and Pokémon up to Gen 4 are fully implemented, along with a majority of abilities.

# How To
- Create a new project with Unity, then import everything in the Assets folder. The Battle scene, which handles single battles, is included as of now (08/24/23), but in the long run other battle modes will be added.

# Credits and Attributions
- Many of the assets used in this game base are taken from Pokémon games, including all map tiles, all sprites up to Generation 3, all cries, many battle animation sprites, and all sound effects. In addition, Pokémon sprites after Gen 3 and some battle sprites were taken from pokeemerald-expansion by the Rom Hacking Hideout.
